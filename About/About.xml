        GlitterTech adds a ton of shiny new and futuristic items found on the richer developed Glitter worlds. But, this
        expensive and illegal tech attracts attention of Glitter world Commandos.

        (Unofficial Version for 1.5 and below)

        Updating Mod:
        
        It can be said this mod is OP. I think it should be, however, in the spirit of being able to play how you want
        to I am adding a few changes to this mod.

        1) Updating to 1.5 (in progress)
        - Starts without any errors
        - I'm still testing (let me know if there are problems)
        2) Adding slider: this will increase everything by a multiplier. (in progress)
        1x: Default, which doesn't change anything
        2x: Max, doubles everything (not recommended)
        .1x: Makes everything suck
        3) Individual sliders: this will target specific items, like beta or alpha poly and allow you to configure
        the individual stats of each item
        4) Craft Glitter Tech: there is a mod for this already but I wanted to add the ability to this mod with the
        ability to turn it on or off. This will be different and require special items only
        found through questing. Similar to relics...
        5) More..... STUFF! Starting with Glitter swords and Glitter psycasts... I think. Not sure if I will ever get
        here but I'm being optimistic

        Let me know in the "Changes" discussion what you want done with this mod and I will do my best to make it
        happen. Link below:

        Release Notes: 1.5.40602
        - Updated to work with release
        
        Release Notes: 1.4.04
        - Titanium is now Titanium_GT which should fix problems with other metal mods that have titanium in them
        - Updated to 1.4: Except:
        - Tanks: big problems here which I am tabling for now
        not sure why this isn't working
        - Tanks have been completely removed and should not spawn so the error shouldn't happen
